#User Story
With the explosion of Craft beer over the past 10 years, it has become impossible to remember all of the beers a person would like to try.  Especially with the popularity of seasonal or limited release beers and the constant output of new styles.  Occasionally, a beer will even change names (i.e. Stone Enjoy By:) making it even more difficult to keep track of beers.

This website was created with the beer enthusiast in mind.  A place to find beers, add beers to a list to try, update that list if the name of the beer changes, and delete those beers that have been sampled.

- A user needs to be able to see a list of beers to choose rendered from an api. Or seeded db?
- Search by brewery, location, beer name, style?
- A user needs to be able to add those beers to a personal list (personal database).
- A user needs to be able to see the listing of beers in personal database.
- A user needs to be able to update beers in personal database.
- A user needs to be able to delete specified beers from personal database.
- A user needs to be able to login to personal database.
- A user needs to be able to log out of personal database


## Old CRA README info
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
