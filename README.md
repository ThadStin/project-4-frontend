# cold ones.

## Overview
With the explosion of Craft beer over the past 10 years, it has become impossible to remember all of the beers a person would like to try.  Especially with the popularity of seasonal or limited release beers and the constant output of new styles. Occasionally, a beer will even change names (i.e. Stone Enjoy By:) making it even more difficult to keep track of beers.

## Technologies Used
'cold ones.' was built with React using Create React App and Ruby on Rails. It has it's own fully functioning API that operates using Ruby on Rails, while the front end runs on React using Create React App. It has full CRUD and is hosted on Heroku.

Other software and techonology used includes:
- NPMjs
- Postgres
- PSQL
- ReactDOM
- ReactModal
- Trello
- Postman

## Approach
We started out by building off of what we learned in class using Ruby On Rails and React CRA. We didn't set out to have a mind-blowing concept, we wanted to showcase the technological skills we had learned in Bootcamp. From there, we took it a step further by employing multiple bang methods, toggle displays, and also installing ReactModal to render modals in the DOM. Finally, we wrote our own CSS to customize the experience.

## User Stories
This website was created with the beer enthusiast in mind.  A place to find beers, add beers to a list to try, update that list if the name of the beer changes, and delete those beers that have been sampled.

- A user needs to be able to see a list of beers to choose rendered from an API.
- A user needs to be able to add those beers to a personal list (personal database).
- A user needs to be able to see the listing of beers in personal database.
- A user needs to be able to update beers in personal database.
- A user needs to be able to delete specified beers from personal database.

## Unsolved Problems
- We initally set out to incorporate information from a secondary API as well as the one we built ourselves. This problem seems within reach, however we simply ran out of time.
- We were unable to set a default value in PSQL / POSTGRES for an image.
- We did not reach our stretch goal of having individual users with encrypted user name and password.

### Notes
#### Jon
This was an extremely rewarding exercise in collaboration. I had a blast working with Thad and problem solving to make this beneficial. Thankfully, we are on the same time zone and similar schedules and were able to work together almost the entire time. We had a few hiccups where we found ourselves working on the same bits of code early on, but as we got better with communication and using our Trello board, we definitely made sure we were working efficiently.
